                        waiting period has been served, some pre-existing conditions that are temporary conditions which
                        have not existed, occurred or shown noticeable signs, symptoms or abnormality after an 18-month
                        period can be reviewed â€” refer to your policy terms and conditions and general exclusions for

                        because it includes additional coverage you may be entitled to for existing conditions.
